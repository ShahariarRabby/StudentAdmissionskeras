# Mini Project: Student Admissions in Keras
**So, finally we're ready to analyze a whole dataset on Keras. We'll analyze the following dataset of student admissions at UCLA: 'http://www.ats.ucla.edu/stat/data/binary.csv'**
## 
**As you follow along this lesson, you are encouraged to open the referenced Jupyter notebooks. We will present a solution to you, but please try creating your own deep learning models! Much of the value in this experience will come from playing around with the code in your own way.**
